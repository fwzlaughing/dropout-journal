\section{Conclusion}
	In this paper, we conduct a systematical study for the dropout problem in MOOCs. We first conduct statistical analyses to identify factors that cause users' dropouts. We found several interesting phenomena such as dropout correlation between courses and dropout influence between friends.  
	%These observations are useful for teachers and MOOCs' designers to better navigate and design courses and platforms in the future. 
	Based on these analyses, 
we propose a context-aware feature interaction network (\modelname{}) to predict users' dropout probability. Our method achieves good performance on two datasets: KDDCUP and XuetangX.
The	proposed method has been deployed onto \textit{XiaoMu}, an intelligent learning assistant in XuetangX  to help improve students retention. We are also working on applying the method to several other systems such as ArnetMiner~\cite{Tang:08KDD}.
